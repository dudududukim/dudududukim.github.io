Welcome ðŸ¤—<br>
I'm Duhyeon Kim, an Electrical and Electronic Engineering major from Korea University.<br>
I have a broad curiosity about all things AI, and I enjoy diving deep into areas where I can focus and grow.

My hope is that, even if just a little, the path I take will leave something valuable for humanity.<br>
My dreams are big, but I'm still figuring out how to make them a reality.

Here are a few topics I've studied or worked on:

- Computer vision / NLP
- FPGA & VLSI
- Computer architecture

ðŸŒˆ Wishing everyone a wonderful day!
