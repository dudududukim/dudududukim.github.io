## üéØ Project Overview

This project aimed to aggressively optimize the *area* and *power* consumption of a Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) forward module for image/video compression, while maintaining image quality (PSNR > 30 dB) and meeting timing constraints.

### üìã Optimization Techniques (Summary)

- **Bitwidth & Coefficient Quantization:** MATLAB simulations determined optimal 8/9-bit setting, ensuring PSNR > 30 dB.
- **Coefficient Symmetry:** Leveraged symmetry in the 12x12 DCT matrix to minimize unique multipliers, significantly reducing area.
- **Sub-expression Sharing:** Identified and shared common expressions in ASUs, although synthesis tools already performed similar optimizations.
- **Coefficient Compression:** Adjusted less significant frequency coefficients (e.g., C10), further reducing logic without PSNR loss.
- **TP Memory Merging:** Combined two transpose memories into one, enabling simultaneous read/write and cutting memory area by ~30%.
- **Glitch/Overflow Management:** Implemented clamping logic at 12-bit truncation to prevent overflow/underflow artifacts.
- **High-Frequency Computation Reduction:** Masked highest frequency outputs (out10, out11) in both DCT stages, preserving PSNR while reducing computations and area.

---

### üî¨ Synthesis & Quality Results

- **Area:** 79% reduction
- **Power:** 63% reduction
- **Image Quality:** PSNR always > 30 dB (e.g., windmill image PSNR ~31‚Äì34 dB after all optimizations)
- **Timing:** All timing constraints met; critical path remains in main DCT computation.

---

### üìà Optimization Process (Log Highlights)

- **Early Trials:** Focused on overflow/glitching fixes.
- **Quantization:** Established 8/9-bit setting for coefficients/intermediates.
- **Symmetry & Sharing:** Reduced multipliers and optimized ASUs.
- **Coefficient Compression:** Fine-tuned coefficients for further reduction.
- **TP_MEM Merge:** Major area savings by merging memories.
- **High-Frequency Removal:** Zeroed high-frequency outputs with no PSNR loss.
- **Final:** Explicitly handled zeroed memory locations for further optimization.

---

> **Summary:** By systematically applying quantization, symmetry, coefficient compression, memory architecture simplification, and high-frequency output masking, the DCT forward module achieved dramatic area and power reductions while consistently meeting image quality and timing requirements.
